# stephiescastle Eagle Library

Custom parts created for Eagle.

## Installation

Follow the [EAGLE Academy tutorial](https://www.autodesk.com/products/eagle/blog/library-basics-install-use-sparkfun-adafruit-libraries-autodesk-eagle/) on adding Sparkfun and Adafruit libraries, but replace Sparkfun and Adafruit with stephiescastle :)

## Included parts

### 2-pin Spring Terminal Block

View this part on [Pololu](https://www.pololu.com/product/2425/pictures). As far as I can tell, it's also the same as [Adafruit's "straight" style spring terminal blocks](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1081) - reconfigurable to 2-pin.
